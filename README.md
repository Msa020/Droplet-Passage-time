# Droplet-Passage-time
I have developed this code to calculate the passage time of a droplet in a channel, passing through some optical LED detectors. 
#tREADMEhe challenge here is, reading the input experimetal data correctly, selecting experimetal parameters like pressure, temperature etc. exactly at each individual passage of the droplet from the detectors.
